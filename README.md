# clinic-system-API
This is where our requests from the front end of the Clinic Appointment System are handled. It serves as both API and back end.

NOTES:
If you want to use the API, simply run "python manage.py runserver" on your CLI. Do know that you need to be in the directory of the API to execute this command.
